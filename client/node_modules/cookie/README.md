Basic HTTP cookie parser and serializer for HTTP servers.

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install cookie
```

## API

```js
var cookie = require('cookie');
```

### cookie.parse(str, options)

Parse an HTTP `Cookie` header string and returning an object of all cookie name-value pairs.
The `str` argument is the string representing a `Cookie` header value and `options` is an
optional object containing additional parsing options.

```js
var cookies = cookie.parse('foo=bar; equation=E%3Dmc%5E2');
// { foo: 'bar', equation: 'E=mc^2' }
```

#### Options

`cookie.parse` accepts these properties in the options object.

##### decode

Specifies a function that will be used to decode a cookie's value. Since the value of a cookie
has a limited character set (and must be a simple string), this function can be used to decode
a previously-encoded cookie value into a JavaScript string or other object.

The default function is the global `decodeURIComponent`, which will decode any URL-encoded
sequences into their byte representations.

**note** if an error is thrown from this function, the original, non-decoded cookie value will
be returned as the cookie's value.

### cookie.serialize(name, value, options)

Serialize a cookie name-value pair into a `Set-Cookie` header string. The `name` argument is the
name for the cookie, the `value` argument is the value to set the cookie to, and the `options`
argument is an optional object containing additional serialization options.

```js
var setCookie = cookie.serialize('foo', 'bar');
// foo=bar
```

#### Options

`cookie.serialize` accepts these properties in the options object.

##### domain

Specifies the value for the [`Domain` `Set-Cookie` attribute][rfc-6265-5.2.3]. By default, no
domain is set, and most clients will consider the cookie to apply to only the current domain.

##### encode

Specifies a function that will be used to encode a cookie's value. Since value of a cookie
has a limited character set (and must be a simple string), this function can be used to encode
a value into a string suited for a cookie's value.

The default function is the global `encodeURIComponent`, which will encode a JavaScript string
into UTF-8 byte sequences and then URL-encode any that fall outside of the cookie range.

##### expires

Specifies the `Date` object to be the value for the [`Expires` `Set-Cookie` attribute][rfc-6265-5.2.1].
By default, no expiration is set, and most clients will consider this a "non-persistent cookie" and
will delete it on a condition like exiting a web browser application.

**note** the [cookie storage model specification][rfc-6265-5.3] states that if both `expires` and
`maxAge` are set, then `maxAge` takes precedence, but it is possible not all clients by obey this,
so if both are set, they should point to the same date and time.

##### httpOnly

Specifies the `boolean` value for the [`HttpOnly` `Set-Cookie` attribute][rfc-6265-5.2.6]. When truthy,
the `HttpOnly` attribute is set, otherwise it is not. By default, the `HttpOnly` attribute is not set.

**note** be careful when setting this to `true`, as compliant clients will not allow client-side
JavaScript to see the cookie in `document.cookie`.

##### maxAge

Specifies the `number` (in seconds) to be the value for the [`Max-Age` `Set-Cookie` attribute][rfc-6265-5.2.2].
The
