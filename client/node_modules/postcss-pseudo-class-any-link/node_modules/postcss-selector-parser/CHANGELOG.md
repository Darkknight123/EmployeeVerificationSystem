- Update PostCSS to 7.0.7 (patch)

# 5.0.0-rc.4

- Fixed and issue where comments immediately after an insensitive
  (in attribute) were not parsed correctly.
- Updated `cssesc` to 2.0.0 (major).
- Removed outdated integration tests.
- Added tests for custom selectors, tags with attributes, the universal
  selector with pseudos, and tokens after combinators.

# 5.0.0-rc.1

To ease adoption of the v5.0 release, we have relaxed the node version
check performed by npm at installation time to allow for node 4, which
remains officially unsupported, but likely to continue working for the
time being.

# 5.0.0-rc.0

This release has **BREAKING CHANGES** that were required to fix regressions
in 4.0.0 and to make the Combinator Node API consistent for all combinator
types. Please read carefully.

## Summary of Changes

* The way a descendent combinator that isn't a single space character (E.g. `.a  .b`) is stored in the AST has changed.
* Named Combinators (E.g. `.a /for/ .b`) are now properly parsed as a combinator.
* It is now possible to look up a node based on the source location of a character in that node and to query nodes if they contain some character.
* Several bug fixes that caused the parser to hang and run out of memory when a `/` was encountered have been fixed.
* The minimum supported version of Node is now `v6.0.0`.

### Changes to the Descendent Combinator

In prior releases, the value of a descendant combinator with multiple spaces included all the spaces.

* `.a   .b`: Extra spaces are now stored as space before.
  - Old & Busted:
    - `combinator.value === "   "`
  - New hotness:
    - `combinator.value === " " && combinator.spaces.before === "  "`
* `.a   /*comment*/.b`: A comment at the end of the combinator causes extra space to become after space.
  - Old & Busted:
    - `combinator.value === "   "`
    - `combinator.raws.value === "   /*comment/"`
  - New hotness:
    - `combinator.value === " "`
    - `combinator.spaces.after === "  "`
    - `combinator.raws.spaces.after === "  /*comment*/"`
* `.a<newline>.b`: whitespace that doesn't start or end with a single space character is stored as a raw value.
  - Old & Busted:
    - `combinator.value === "\n"`
    - `combinator.raws.value === undefined`
  - New hotness:
    - `combinator.value === " "`
    - `combinator.raws.value === "\n"`

### Support for "Named Combinators"

Although, nonstandard and unlikely to ever become a standard, combinators like `/deep/` and `/for/` are now properly supported.

Because they've been taken off the standardization track, there is no spec-official name for combinators of the form `/<ident>/`. However, I talked to [Tab Atkins](https://twitter.com/tabatkins) and we agreed to call them "named combinators" so now they are called that.

Before this release such named combinators were parsed without intention and generated three nodes of type `"tag"` where the first and last nodes had a value of `"/"`.

* `.a /for/ .b` is parsed as a combinator.
  - Old & Busted:
    - `root.nodes[0].nodes[1].type === "tag"`
    - `root.nodes[0].nodes[1].value === "/"`
  - New hotness:
    - `root.nodes[0].nodes[1].type === "combinator"`
    - `root.nodes[0].nodes[1].value === "/for/"`
* `.a /F\6fR/ .b` escapes are handled and uppercase is normalized.
  - Old & Busted:
    - `root.nodes[0].nodes[2].type === "tag"`
    - `root.nodes[0].nodes[2].value === "F\\6fR"`
  - New hotness:
    - `root.nodes[0].nodes[1].type === "combinator"`
    - `root.nodes[0].nodes[1].value === "/for/"`
    - `root.nodes[0].nodes[1].raws.value === "/F\\6fR/"`

### Source position checks and lookups

A new API was added to look up a node based on the source location.

```js
const selectorParser = require("postcss-selector-parser");
// You can find the most specific node for any given character
let combinator = selectorParser.astSync(".a > .b").atPosition(1,4);
combinator.toString() === " > ";
// You can check if a node includes a specific character
// Whitespace surrounding the node that is owned by that node
// is included in the check.
[2,3,4,5,6].map(column => combinator.isAtPosition(1, column));
// => [false, true, true, true, false]
```

# 4.0.0

This release has **BREAKING CHANGES** that were required to fix bugs regarding values with escape sequences. Please read carefully.

* **Identifiers with escapes** - CSS escape sequences are now hidden from the public API by default.
  The normal value of a node like a class name or ID, or an aspect of a node such as attribute
  selector's value, is unescaped. Escapes representing Non-ascii characters are unescaped into
  unicode characters. For example: `bu\tton, .\31 00, #i\2764\FE0Fu, [attr="value is \"quoted\""]`
  will parse respectively to the values `button`, `100`, `i❤️u`, `value is "quoted"`.
  The original escape sequences for these values can be found in the corresponding property name
  in `node.raws`. Where possible, deprecation warnings were added, but the nature
  of escape handling makes it impossible to detect what is escaped or not. Our expectation is
  that most users are neither expecting nor handling escape sequences in their use of this library,
  and so for them, this is a bug fix. Users who are taking care to handle escapes correctly can
  now update their code to remove the escape handling and let us do it for them.

* **Mutating values with escapes** - When you make an update to a node property that has escape handling
  The value is assumed to be unescaped, and any special characters are escaped automatically and
  the corresponding `raws` value is immediately updated. This can result in changes to the original
  escape format. Where the exact value of the escape sequence is important there are methods that
  allow both values to be set in conjunction. There are a number of new convenience methods for
  manipulating values that involve escapes, especially for attributes values where the quote mark
  is involved. See https://github.com/postcss/postcss-selector-parser/pull/133 for an extensive
  write-up on these changes.


**Upgrade/API Example**

In `3.x` there was no unescape handling and internal consistency of several properties was the caller's job to maintain. It was very easy for the developer
to create a CSS file that did not parse correctly when some types of values
were in use.

```js
const selectorParser = require("postcss-selector-parser");
let attr = selectorParser.attribute({attribute: "id", operator: "=", value: "a-value"});
attr.value; // => "a-value"
attr.toString(); // => [id=a-value]
// Add quotes to an attribute's value.
// All these values have to be set by the caller to be consistent:
// no internal consistency is maintained.
attr.raws.unquoted = attr.value
attr.value = "'" + attr.value + "'";
attr.value; // => "'a-value'"
attr.quoted = true;
attr.toString();  // => "[id='a-value']"
```

In `4.0` there is a convenient API for setting and mutating values
that may need escaping. Especially for attributes.

```js
const selectorParser = require("postcss-selector-parser");

// The constructor requires you specify the exact escape sequence
let className = selectorParser.className({value: "illegal class name", raws: {value: "illegal\\ class\\ name"}});
className.toString(); // => '.illegal\\ class\\ name'

// So it's better to set the value as a property
className = selectorParser.className();
// Most properties that deal with identifiers work like this
className.value = "escape for me";
className.value; // => 'escape for me'
className.toString(); // => '.escape\\ for\\ me'

// emoji and all non-ascii are escaped to ensure it works in every css file.
className.value = "😱🦄😍";
className.value; // => '😱🦄😍'
className.toString(); // => '.\\1F631\\1F984\\1F60D'

// you can control the escape sequence if you want, or do bad bad things
className.setPropertyAndEscape('value', 'xxxx', 'yyyy');
className.value; // => "xxxx"
className.toString(); // => ".yyyy"

// Pass a value directly through to the css output without escaping it. 
className.setPropertyWithoutEscape('value', '$REPLACE_ME$');
className.value; // => "$REPLACE_ME$"
className.t
